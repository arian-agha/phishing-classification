            <p class="body">There will be <b>five phishing</b> and <b>five legitimate</b> emails in an undisclosed order, and your task is to <b>classify</b> them correctly.</p>
            <p class="body">There will be <b>five sets</b>, each containing <b>two emails</b>. You have <b>12 seconds</b> to view each email.</p>
            <p class="body">After every set, you will be asked to make your classification for both emails that you were shown.
            <p class="body">Before every set, a "gaze calibration" will be performed through your webcam, which is a simple 30-second process.</p>
            <p class="body">Only anonymised gaze data with the corresponding classifications are stored. <b>No other data is stored</b>.</p>
            <p class="body">The process should take <b>about 10 minutes in total</b>.</p>
